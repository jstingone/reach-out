This folder contains all of the code used for analysis of the INSIGHT harmonized data, corresponding to Aim 1 of the REACH-OUT project.

This folder contains two subfolders:

dataprep: code used to construct study populations, clean data and operationalize exposures, outcomes and confounders;

analysis: descriptives, modelling, and visualizations

Within each folder, we have further distinguished between inpatient populations and emergency department populations.

NOTE: Preparation of the neighborhood environmental vulnerability index is not included here, but is available within its GitHub Repository. Link is in the main README file.
