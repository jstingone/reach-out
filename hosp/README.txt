This folder contains all of the code used for analysis of the INSIGHT harmonized data, corresponding to Aim 1 of the REACH-OUT project.

This folder contains two subfolders:

dataprep: code used to construct study populations, clean data and operationalize exposures, outcomes and confounders;

analysis: descriptives, modelling, and visualizations

Within each folder, we have further distinguished between inpatient populations and emergency department populations.

NOTE: Preparation of the neighborhood environmental vulnerability index is not included here, but is available within its GitHub Repository. Final data dictionary is included in dataprep folder. Link to data and programming code is in the main README file.
