This folder contains programming code related to primary data analysis and visualization of hospitalization and ED data within INSIGHT. 
 
All files with brief descriptions are listed below.

* Descriptives.RMD: R Markdown document that generates input data for visualization of spatial distribution and creates visualization of temporal distribution of data.

* Table 1 & Correlation Plots.RMD: R Markdown document that creates Table 1 for final report and visualizations of correlations between pollutants and NEVI

* Mapping.RMD: R Markdown document that creates maps for visualization of spatial distribution of cases

* CrudeAnalyses.RMD: R Markdown document that creates function for running crude models of association; includes all COVID hospitalization outcomes

* AdjAnalyses_Int.RMD: R Markdown document that creates function for running adjusted models of association, testing for interaction between air pollutant and NEVI and obtaining straum-specific estimates of air pollution associations within strata of NEVI; includes all COVID hospitalization outcomes

* AdjAnalyses_Comorb_Strat.RMD:R Markdown document that creates function for running adjusted models of association within subpopulations of interest (defined by characteristics and comorbidities)

* multipoll.RMD:R Markdown document that creates function for running adjusted models of association, adjusting for a second pollutant

* RERI Analyses(Function).RMD: R Markdown document that creates functions to calculate RERI and 95% CI for joint effects of air pollutants and comorbidities

* EDAdjAnalysesInt.RMD:R Markdown document that creates function for running adjusted models of association between air pollution and hospitalization after ED visit, testing for interaction between air pollutant and NEVI and obtaining straum-specific estimates of air pollution associations within strata of NEVI

* CategoricalPoll Analyses.RMD: R Markdown document that creates function for running adjusted models when air pollution data is operationalized as a categorical variable

* NEVIDomains Analysis.RMD: R Markdown document that creates function for running adjusted models using indiviual NEVI domains rather than overall index
